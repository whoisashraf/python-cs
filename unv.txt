Do you respond to feedback, suggestions, or criticism with a fixed or growth mindset? Why?
Using a growth mindset, how would you respond to constructive criticism from your peers?

Answers
1. I believe that I personally respond to feedback, criticism, or suggestions with a growth mindset. Up until recently, I did not respond to feedback, criticism, or suggestions with a growth mindset because I was too young and naive. I am a bit of a perfectionist and I didn't take feedback, criticism, or suggestions well in the past. Fast forward to the present and I now see the value in seeing things from someone else's perspective. Why did I suddenly value feedback, constructive criticism, and suggestions? It's because I realized that there isn't a single answer to anything, it's all about how you view things. Being open to feedback, suggestions, or criticism(i.e having a growth mindset) has helped me understand and think about much more than I would have been able to on my own. Being someone who has little interest in psychology, I also get to experience a person's thought process(to an extent) by learning their opinions, suggestions and feedback on what I have done. These are the reasons why I try to take feedback, suggestions, or criticism with an open mind and learn from them.

2. Constructive criticism helps me address flaws and errors that stem from my thought process. It also helps me discover my biases on a certain topic. By being open to feedback, I get to question my choices and why I've made them which helps me learn. When I receive feedback that questions my work or opinion, I try to understand the critics point of view and compare it against mine. Once I realize that I am in the wrong, I take the following steps: admitting my flaws, thanking the critic, and making corrections to my work, among others.
